# ProyectoSego - React (migrated)

This is a Vite + React scaffold created by migration script.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The pages are generated from original HTML files and rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` inside React components. Edit `/src/pages` to replace with proper JSX as needed.
